# Basic-Loan-Calculator
Extremely basic java swing application made using Netbeans GUI builder. Might be useful for college java mini-project submissions, not really polished or modern but might get you a passing-to-decent grade.

Choose the type of loan you want- personal, car, home and 4 banks will come up with their offering interest rate. Enter loan amount, no. of years for which you want the loan, interest rate (compounded yearly) and the system will display monthly and total payment over the years to be done.
